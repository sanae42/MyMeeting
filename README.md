Design and Implementation of Conference Management Android Application

In recent years, a large number of conference-related mobile applications have emerged in China's Android application market, most of which are mainly oriented to online video conferencing. However, there is no android application specially oriented to offline conference with great influence in Mainland China. Offline meetings have a high utilization rate among users especially teachers and students, ctivities such as academic meetings and community meetings are conducted in the form of offline meetings. Mobile applications oriented to offline meetings have broad market prospects.
Given the situation, I developed an Android application for offline meetings, which is committed to providing a complete set of solutions for offline meetings, hoping that this application can bring users a better offline meeting experience. The application uses Java language for development, adopts MVC architecture as its software architecture, and bmob cloud database, instant messaging, LBS, QSCode and other popular technologies and tools are used for its development.
This application finally realized functions of user login and registration, meeting browsing and searching, meeting map navigation, meeting notes, meeting calendar, meeting reminder, meeting bulletin board, meeting scanning code sign-in, user private message chat and meeting group chat and many other functions, designed and realized a simple and elegant interface.
